<!-- /qrcode-ai-readme-actions:v2 -->

Use this command adapter when a PHP application can invoke a separately installed qrscan executable. It keeps the scanner out of the PHP process and returns the original report, leaving storage and business decisions to your application. The public source and tag do not by themselves establish Packagist availability; verify the registry before relying on the Composer command below.

The [QR code scanner](https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/qr-code-scanner) and [barcode scanner](https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/barcode-scanner) are QR Code AI’s browser scanning entry points. For the corresponding development route, the [QR code scanner PHP guide](https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/qr-code-scanner/sdk/php) and [barcode scanner PHP guide](https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/barcode-scanner/sdk/php) connect this documentation to the two product journeys. If a product page is unavailable, the instructions and references in this README remain the starting point for this source directory.

To prepare a label for a PHP upload or batch workflow, use the [QR code generator](https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/qr-code-generator) or the [barcode generator](https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/barcode-generator). Keep the original payload with the exported image so that you can compare the scan result with the value you intended to encode.

Read QR codes and barcodes from an image file in PHP. This package drives the installed
`qrscan` command of the
[QR Code & Barcode Scanner engine](https://github.com/qrcode-ai-com/qrcode-barcode-scanner)
and returns its JSON report unchanged. It holds no decoder of its own.

## Install

```sh
composer require qrcode-ai-com/qrcode-barcode-scanner:^0.11
```

The package follows the engine it drives: version 0.11.x of the package works with `qrscan`
0.11.x. The first version is 0.11.0.

## What you need

- PHP 8.2 or later, with `proc_open` enabled. Some shared hosts disable it: the package then
  throws `ProcessUnavailable`.
- The `qrscan` command, version 0.11.x, installed separately. The
  [distribution guide](https://github.com/qrcode-ai-com/qrcode-barcode-scanner/blob/0b8cc607536557dbe6a38aef2dd0a16f781224cf/distribution/README.md) lists the routes: Homebrew, Scoop, the
  Debian and RPM packages, the AUR, `cargo install`, the release archives and the container
  image. This package never downloads it.

## Scan an image

```php
use QrcodeAi\BarcodeScanner\Profile;
use QrcodeAi\BarcodeScanner\Scanner;

$scanner = new Scanner();                    // `qrscan` on PATH; or new Scanner('/path/to/qrscan')
$report = $scanner->scan('label.png', Profile::Fast);

foreach ($report->detections() as $detection) {
    echo $detection['symbology'], ': ', $detection['content']['text'], "\n";
}
```

`scan()` takes the file, a profile and an optional time budget in milliseconds:

| Profile | What the engine does |
| --- | --- |
| `Profile::Frame` | Decodes only. The report carries no score. |
| `Profile::Fast` | Decodes first, with a reduced judgment. |
| `Profile::Full` | Decodes and judges how well a QR code scans. The default. |

A budget of `0` is unbounded: the result then does not depend on how busy the machine is.
Without a budget the profile's own applies, and a busy machine can cut the scan short.

## Read the report

`$report->data` is the engine's report as a PHP array, and `$report->json` is the exact text the
engine printed. Nothing is renamed, rounded or recalculated. Keep `json` when you store the
report: a PHP array cannot tell an empty object from an empty list.

| Method | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `found()` | At least one code was decoded. |
| `detections()` | One entry per distinct content, with `symbology`, `content`, `payload` and its measured places. |
| `texts()` | The decoded text of each detection. |
| `rawPayloads()` | The exact bytes of each detection, for content that is not text. |
| `score()` | The scannability judgment, or `null`. |
| `isComplete()` | `false` when the time budget cut the scan. |
| `engineVersion()` | The engine that wrote the report, such as `0.11.0`. |

Three things are easy to get wrong:

- **No code is a result, not an error.** `found()` is `false` and no exception is thrown.
- **A missing score is not zero.** `score()` is `null` with `Profile::Frame`, or when the
  budget ran out before the judgment.
- **An incomplete scan proves nothing.** When `isComplete()` is `false`, an empty report does
  not mean the image holds no code. Scan again with a larger budget or with `0`.

Decoded text is untrusted data: a QR code can hold any text. Do not follow its links or run it.

## When something fails

Every failure is a `QrcodeAi\BarcodeScanner\Exception\ScannerException`:

| Exception | When |
| --- | --- |
| `BinaryNotFound` | `qrscan` could not be started: not installed, not on `PATH`, not executable. |
| `UnsupportedVersion` | The installed `qrscan` is not 0.11.x. The check runs before the first scan. |
| `ScanFailed` | The engine refused the file or the options. `engineCode` holds its code when it gives one, such as `QRS-001` for a file that is not an image. |
| `ScanTimedOut` | `qrscan` did not end within the timeout, 60 seconds by default, and was stopped. |
| `ProcessUnavailable` | This PHP cannot start a process. |

## What it does and does not do

- One scan starts one process. That suits a request or a job. It is the wrong tool for
  thousands of images in a tight loop.
- It reads image files: PNG, JPEG, WebP and GIF. To scan bytes you hold in memory, write them
  to a temporary file first.
- The command is started from a list of arguments, with no shell. A file name is never
  interpreted, whatever it holds: spaces, quotes, a leading dash or shell characters.
- It writes nothing, fetches nothing and never opens what a code points to.

## Develop

The tests run against a real `qrscan`, not a stand-in:

```sh
composer install
QRSCAN_BINARY=/path/to/qrscan QRSCAN_FIXTURES=/path/to/engine/fixtures vendor/bin/phpunit
```

They cover the three profiles on an image that holds a QR code and a Code 128, an image with no
code, files that are not images, awkward file names, a missing command, an engine of another
version and a command that hangs. The workflow `PHP adapter` of the engine repository runs them
on Linux, macOS and Windows against the released command.

## Its own repository

Packagist reads `composer.json` at the root of a repository, and Composer downloads that whole
repository. The package is therefore served from a small repository of its own,
`qrcode-ai-com/qrcode-barcode-scanner-php`. Nothing there is edited by hand:
[`scripts/stage-php-package.py`](https://github.com/qrcode-ai-com/qrcode-barcode-scanner/blob/0b8cc607536557dbe6a38aef2dd0a16f781224cf/scripts/stage-php-package.py) writes its whole tree from
one commit of the engine repository, with the workflow of [`mirror/`](.github/workflows/), the two test
images, the licence and a `SOURCE.json` that names the commit and the sha256 of every file. The
same program checks that a tree is exactly that. Change the package here, then stage it again.

## Licence

AGPL-3.0-or-later, like the engine it drives. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).
